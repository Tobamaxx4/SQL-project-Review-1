# SQL-project-Review-1
This was a brush on project on SQL. Just practicing and reviewing the Basics again.

I got the datasdet from @najirh on github.
It is a sales Report csv files with about 10 diffrent tasks to solve. 


Please note: This project might seem very basic and beginer friendly. ENJOY
